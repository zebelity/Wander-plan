## Description
The application allows users to add itinerary items to their trips, including flights, car trips, hotels, and sightseeing activities. Users can specify the type of each itinerary item, along with relevant details such as location, duration, and booking references.

To ensure privacy and personalized experiences, the application provides user authentication functionality. Users need to log in and access their own trips and itineraries.
